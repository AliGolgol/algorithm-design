### [52. N-Queens II](./src/main/java/leetcode/NQueensII.java)
The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing n queens on an n x n chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.

Given an integer n, return the number of distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle.

#### Example1:
````
Input: n = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two distinct solutions to the 4-queens puzzle as shown.
````

#### Example2:
````
Input: n = 1
Output: 1
````

#### Constraints:

- 1 <= n <= 9

### [164. Maximum Gap](./src/main/java/leetcode/MaximumGap.java)
Given an integer array nums, return the maximum difference between two successive elements in its sorted form. If the array contains less than two elements, return 0.

You must write an algorithm that runs in linear time and uses linear extra space.

#### Example1:
````
Input: nums = [3,6,9,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: The sorted form of the array is [1,3,6,9], either (3,6) or (6,9) has the maximum difference 3.
````

#### Example2:
````
Input: nums = [10]
Output: 0
Explanation: The array contains less than 2 elements, therefore return 0.
````

#### Constraints:

- 1 <= nums.length <= 10^4
- 0 <= nums[i] <= 10^9

### [1695. Maximum Erasure Value](./src/main/java/leetcode/MaximumUniqueSubarray.java)
You are given an array of positive integers nums and want to erase a subarray containing unique elements. The score you get by erasing the subarray is equal to the sum of its elements.

Return the maximum score you can get by erasing exactly one subarray.

An array b is called to be a subarray of a if it forms a contiguous subsequence of a, that is, if it is equal to a[l],a[l+1],...,a[r] for some (l,r).

#### Example1:
````
Input: nums = [4,2,4,5,6]
Output: 17
Explanation: The optimal subarray here is [2,4,5,6].
````

#### Example2:
````
Input: nums = [5,2,1,2,5,2,1,2,5]
Output: 8
Explanation: The optimal subarray here is [5,2,1] or [1,2,5].
````

#### Constraints:

- 1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
- 1 <= nums[i] <= 10^4
