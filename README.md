### [Open the Lock](./src/main/java/leetcode/MaximumUniqueSubarray.java)
You have a lock in front of you with 4 circular wheels. Each wheel has 10 slots: '0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9'. The wheels can rotate freely and wrap around: for example we can turn '9' to be '0', or '0' to be '9'. Each move consists of turning one wheel one slot.

The lock initially starts at '0000', a string representing the state of the 4 wheels.

You are given a list of deadends dead ends, meaning if the lock displays any of these codes, the wheels of the lock will stop turning and you will be unable to open it.

Given a target representing the value of the wheels that will unlock the lock, return the minimum total number of turns required to open the lock, or -1 if it is impossible.

#### Example1:
````
Input: deadends = ["0201","0101","0102","1212","2002"], target = "0202"
Output: 6
Explanation:
A sequence of valid moves would be "0000" -> "1000" -> "1100" -> "1200" -> "1201" -> "1202" -> "0202".
Note that a sequence like "0000" -> "0001" -> "0002" -> "0102" -> "0202" would be invalid,
because the wheels of the lock become stuck after the display becomes the dead end "0102".
````

#### Example2:
````
Input: deadends = ["8888"], target = "0009"
Output: 1
Explanation:
We can turn the last wheel in reverse to move from "0000" -> "0009".
````
#### Example3:
````
Input: deadends = ["8887","8889","8878","8898","8788","8988","7888","9888"], target = "8888"
Output: -1
Explanation:
We can't reach the target without getting stuck.
````
#### Example4:
````
Input: deadends = ["0000"], target = "8888"
Output: -1
````

#### Constraints:

- 1 <= deadends.length <= 500
- deadends[i].length == 4
- target.length == 4
- target will not be in the list deadends.
- target and deadends[i] consist of digits only

You are given two integers n and k and two integer arrays speed and efficiency both of length n. There are n engineers numbered from 1 to n. speed[i] and efficiency[i] represent the speed and efficiency of the ith engineer respectively.

Choose at most k different engineers out of the n engineers to form a team with the maximum performance.

The performance of a team is the sum of their engineers' speeds multiplied by the minimum efficiency among their engineers.

Return the maximum performance of this team. Since the answer can be a huge number, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.
#### Example1:
````
Input: n = 6, speed = [2,10,3,1,5,8], efficiency = [5,4,3,9,7,2], k = 2
Output: 60
Explanation: 
We have the maximum performance of the team by selecting engineer 2 (with speed=10 and efficiency=4) and engineer 5 (with speed=5 and efficiency=7). That is, performance = (10 + 5) * min(4, 7) = 60.
````

#### Example2:
````
Input: n = 6, speed = [2,10,3,1,5,8], efficiency = [5,4,3,9,7,2], k = 3

### [My Calendar I](./src/main/java/leetcode/MyCalendarI.java)
Implement a MyCalendar class to store your events. A new event can be added if adding the event will not cause a double booking.

Your class will have the method, book(int start, int end). Formally, this represents a booking on the half open interval [start, end), the range of real numbers x such that start <= x < end.

A double booking happens when two events have some non-empty intersection (ie., there is some time that is common to both events.)

For each call to the method MyCalendar.book, return true if the event can be added to the calendar successfully without causing a double booking. Otherwise, return false and do not add the event to the calendar.

Your class will be called like this: MyCalendar cal = new MyCalendar(); MyCalendar.book(start, end)
#### Example1:
````
MyCalendar();
MyCalendar.book(10, 20); // returns true
MyCalendar.book(15, 25); // returns false
MyCalendar.book(20, 30); // returns true
Explanation: 
The first event can be booked.  The second can't because time 15 is already booked by another event.
The third event can be booked, as the first event takes every time less than 20, but not including 20.
````
#### Constraints:
- The number of calls to MyCalendar.book per test case will be at most 1000.
- In calls to MyCalendar.book(start, end), start and end are integers in the range [0, 10^9].

### [Stone Game VII](./src/main/java/leetcode/StoneGameVII.java)
Alice and Bob take turns playing a game, with Alice starting first.

There are n stones arranged in a row. On each player's turn, they can remove either the leftmost stone or the rightmost stone from the row and receive points equal to the sum of the remaining stones' values in the row. The winner is the one with the higher score when there are no stones left to remove.

Bob found that he will always lose this game (poor Bob, he always loses), so he decided to minimize the score's difference. Alice's goal is to maximize the difference in the score.

Given an array of integers stones where stones[i] represents the value of the ith stone from the left, return the difference in Alice and Bob's score if they both play optimally.
#### Example1:
````
Input: stones = [5,3,1,4,2]
Output: 6
Explanation: 
- Alice removes 2 and gets 5 + 3 + 1 + 4 = 13 points. Alice = 13, Bob = 0, stones = [5,3,1,4].
- Bob removes 5 and gets 3 + 1 + 4 = 8 points. Alice = 13, Bob = 8, stones = [3,1,4].
- Alice removes 3 and gets 1 + 4 = 5 points. Alice = 18, Bob = 8, stones = [1,4].
- Bob removes 1 and gets 4 points. Alice = 18, Bob = 12, stones = [4].
- Alice removes 4 and gets 0 points. Alice = 18, Bob = 12, stones = [].
The score difference is 18 - 12 = 6.
````
#### Example2:
````
Input: stones = [7,90,5,1,100,10,10,2]
Output: 122
````
#### Constraints:
- n == stones.length
- 2 <= n <= 1000

### [Minimum Number of Refueling Stops](./src/main/java/leetcode/MinimumNumberRefuelingStops.java)
A car travels from a starting position to a destination which is target miles east of the starting position.

Along the way, there are gas stations.  Each station[i] represents a gas station that is station[i][0] miles east of the starting position, and has station[i][1] liters of gas.

The car starts with an infinite tank of gas, which initially has startFuel liters of fuel in it.  It uses 1 liter of gas per 1 mile that it drives.

When the car reaches a gas station, it may stop and refuel, transferring all the gas from the station into the car.

What is the least number of refueling stops the car must make in order to reach its destination?  If it cannot reach the destination, return -1.

Note that if the car reaches a gas station with 0 fuel left, the car can still refuel there.  If the car reaches the destination with 0 fuel left, it is still considered to have arrived.
#### Example1:
````
Input: target = 1, startFuel = 1, stations = []
Output: 0
Explanation: We can reach the target without refueling.
````
#### Example2:
````
Input: target = 100, startFuel = 1, stations = [[10,100]]
Output: -1
Explanation: We can't reach the target (or even the first gas station).
````
#### Example3:
````
Input: target = 100, startFuel = 10, stations = [[10,60],[20,30],[30,30],[60,40]]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
We start with 10 liters of fuel.
We drive to position 10, expending 10 liters of fuel.  We refuel from 0 liters to 60 liters of gas.
Then, we drive from position 10 to position 60 (expending 50 liters of fuel),
and refuel from 10 liters to 50 liters of gas.  We then drive to and reach the target.
We made 2 refueling stops along the way, so we return 2.
````
#### Note:
- 1 <= target, startFuel, stations[i][1] <= 10^9
- 0 <= stations.length <= 500
- 0 < stations[0][0] < stations[1][0] < ... < stations[stations.length-1][0] < target

[[[1, 3, 5]], [0, 2], [1, 2], [0, 2]]
Output
[null, 9, null, 8]

Explanation
NumArray numArray = new NumArray([1, 3, 5]);
numArray.sumRange(0, 2); // return 1 + 3 + 5 = 9
numArray.update(1, 2);   // nums = [1, 2, 5]
numArray.sumRange(0, 2); // return 1 + 2 + 5 = 8
````
#### Constraints:
- 1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 10^4
- -100 <= nums[i] <= 100
- 0 <= index < nums.length
- -100 <= val <= 100
- 0 <= left <= right < nums.length
- At most 3 * 10^4 calls will be made to update and sumRange
